A peak element is an element that is strictly greater than its neighbors.

Given a 0-indexed integer array nums, find a peak element, and return its index. If the array contains multiple peaks, return the index to any of the peaks.

You may imagine that nums[-1] = nums[n] = -âˆž. In other words, an element is always considered to be strictly greater than a neighbor that is outside the array.

You must write an algorithm that runs in O(log n) time.

class PeakElement {
    public int findPeakElement(int[] nums) {
        int low = 0, high = nums.length-1;

        while(low < high) {
            int mid1 = low + (high - low) / 2;
            int mid2 = mid1 + 1;

            if (nums[mid1] < nums[mid2]) low = mid2;
            else high = mid1;
        }
        return low;
    }
